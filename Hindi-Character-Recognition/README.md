# Hindi Character Recognition

This project implements a **Hindi Character Recognition** system using **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**. The model is trained on a dataset of Hindi characters and can classify images into 25 unique classes.

## **Project Overview**
The system:
- **Preprocesses images**: Converts images to grayscale, reduces noise, and resizes them to a standard format.
- **Extracts features**: Flattens images into vectors.
- **Normalizes data**: Uses `StandardScaler` for feature scaling.
- **Trains an SVM classifier**: Uses a linear SVM model for
